# Algorithms-Data-Structures-JavaScript
This repository contains the problems, patterns, and other information covered in the "Algorithms & Data Structures in JavaScript Masterclass" course by Colt Steele.

It might be useful to someone out there as well to find this repo, and it's an additional chance for me to use git 😁
