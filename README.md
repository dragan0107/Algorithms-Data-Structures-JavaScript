# Algorithms-Data-Structures-JavaScript
This repository contains the problems, patterns, and other information covered in the "Algorithms & Data Structures in JavaScript Masterclass" course by Colt Steele.

Here, I'm trying to level up my problem solving skills, and try to apply as many algorithms and patterns as posssible,
and have my solutions more effective, faster and less resource consuming. I found this course to be super useful, it has 
really helped me out so far.
